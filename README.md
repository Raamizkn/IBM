# Creative Spark Agent - watsonx.ai Hackathon PoC

## Project Description

Creative Spark Agent is a lightweight, command-line proof-of-concept designed to combat creative stagnation and boost productivity by leveraging IBM's AI capabilities. It directly addresses the common business challenge where individuals and teams face creative blocks, hindering innovation and slowing down workflows. This lack of fresh ideas can impede project progress and limit exploration of new solutions.

Our solution is a simple Python script, using the `ibm-watsonx-ai` library, that interacts with IBM's Granite foundation models (specifically `ibm/granite-3-8b-instruct` in this PoC) hosted on the watsonx.ai platform. The target users are diverse â€“ developers needing function ideas, marketers brainstorming campaign slogans, writers seeking content angles, or anyone requiring a quick injection of creative input. Users simply run the script, provide a topic via the command line, and receive a list of unique ideas generated by the AI.

The creativity of this solution lies in its focused simplicity and direct application of IBM's enterprise-grade AI. While AI brainstorming tools exist, this PoC demonstrates how easily watsonx.ai and Granite models can be integrated into a developer's workflow for rapid, targeted idea generation without complex interfaces. It showcases the power and accessibility of IBM's AI platform for tangible, immediate productivity gains. The agent effectively uses the Granite LLM to generate diverse outputs efficiently, providing multiple starting points for creative tasks within seconds, showcasing a novel application of IBM's technology in a readily usable format for quick creative assistance.
